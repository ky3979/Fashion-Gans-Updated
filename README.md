## Running the training simulation
- Uncomment the code block in section 1.2.8.3 (1.2.8.4 too if you want to make a gif of the evolution).
- The training requires some expensive hardware to effectively run
- For fast training, run the simulation on a VM (I used paperspace).
- Use 300-500 epochs for decent results. This will take you about 45-60 minutes.
- Run the training code cell block
